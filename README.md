This is a driver I am making to learn something about drivers for USB devices.
Please note that this is still in development.

####To-Do
There is some work left to do:
* Make the event handling better (??)
* Reporting current settings to a HUD (??)
* Writing new configs to the mouse
* Reading configs from the mouse (maybe it's not even possible, didn't sniff enough)
